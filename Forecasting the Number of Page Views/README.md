# Forecasting the Number of Page Views

An ads and marketing company is helping businesses elicit maximum clicks @ minimum cost. They are building an ad infrastructure to help businesses promote themselves easily, effectively, and economically. The interplay of 3 AI modules - Design, Dispense, and Decipher, come together to make it this an end-to-end 3 step process digital advertising solution for all.

The objective here is to understand the per-page view report for different Wikipedia pages for 550 days and forecast the number of views so their data science team can predict and optimise Ad placement for their clients.

*The clients could belong to different regions, and hence they need data on how their ads will perform on pages in different languages.*
