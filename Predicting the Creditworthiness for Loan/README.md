# Predicting the Creditworthiness for Loan

80% of rural individuals and businesses find it difficult to access formal credit. The data science team at a rural-focused fintech aims to brige this credit gap in the rural market by building an underwriting layer to determine the creditworthiness of MSMEs as well as individuals.

Formal credit in the rural economy can be deployed via two main financial instruments:

1. __Buy Now, Pay Later__: Where a customer can avail credit at the point of sale to purchase goods.
2. __Supply Chain Financing__: Where a business partnered with the fintech can finance invoices and/or purchase orders to bridge the gap in payable and receivable credit cycles.

This case study will focus on the underwriting process behind __Supply Chain Financing__.
