# Anamoly Detection of Hydrogen Fuel Cell

An electric vehicle company is experimenting on making Indiaâ€™s next hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV). An FCEV is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, which generates electric power using on-board hydrogen. On a full tank, this FCEV can go up to a claimed 600 kilometers.

The data science team at this company is trying to understand the parameters related to Hydrogen Fuel cell sensors. The task here is to analyze the aging process, charge, and discharge cycle of the cell and isolate some anomalies/ instances found in the data.
