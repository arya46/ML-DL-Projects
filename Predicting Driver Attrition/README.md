# Predicting Driver Attrition

Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry watchers as a tough battle for a ride-sharing company. Churn among drivers is high and it’s very easy for drivers to stop working for the company on the fly or jump to their competition depending on the rates.

As the companies get bigger, the high churn could become a bigger problem. To find new drivers, a ride-sharing company is casting a wide net, including people who don’t have cars for jobs. But this acquisition is really costly. Losing drivers frequently impacts the morale of the organization and acquiring new drivers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.

This case study is focused on predicting driver attrition. We are provided with the monthly information for a segment of drivers for 2019 and 2020 and the task is to predict whether a driver will be leaving the company or not based on a given set of attributes.
